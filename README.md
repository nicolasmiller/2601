2601
====

An Audio Unit Atari 2600 Tia sound chip emulator. Port of Ron Fries' TiaSound.

Note: as described here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Interface_Adapter#Noise.2FTone_Generator_.28AUD0.2F1.29, the Tia is not a fully musical chip. Pitch is controlled by crude 5-bit frequency dividers. Right now, the plugin does not change frequency in response to particular MIDI note values. MIDI simply triggers the sound. The frequency registers must be modulated appropriately (or inappropriately) with automation in your DAW.

A copy of the built component is available here: http://nicolasmiller.github.com/2601.dmg

Happy glitching!
